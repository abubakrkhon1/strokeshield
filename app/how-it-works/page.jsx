            <p>
              Using your camera, StrokeShield analyzes your smile to detect any asymmetry in facial muscles.
              Facial asymmetry can be a key early indicator of stroke, and our AI model measures this in real time.

              Next, the app asks you to raise your eyebrows. It scans for evenness and muscle coordination between both sides of your face.
              Any abnormal movement patterns are recorded and analyzed.

              Stroke can affect speech clarity. You‚Äôll be prompted to read a short sentence out loud, and our system will analyze your
